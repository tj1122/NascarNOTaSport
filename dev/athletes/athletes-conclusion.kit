            <p><span>Successful racecar drivers are dependent on a great engine and the speed of which they can pit stop.</span> Nothing has to do with their physical attributes. You could be out of shape with little strength and still be a great driver;</p>
            <h3>this does not apply to any professional sport.</h3>
            <p>We can say the racer has skill but cannot call them an athlete since the competition is not testing any physical limitation of the body: a driver’s physical strengths do not benefit how they race. </p>

    <h3 id="athletes-end">At the end of the day auto racing’s limit is based on the performance of a machine, not the physical capabilities of the person operating it. The machine’s performance is determined by crew and the crew chief, not the driver. </h3>
