                    <p>No, I didn't think I have the physical endurance to play for 12 hours straight at the World Series of Poker, either. Giving birth to a baby is also physically demanding. Sex is a very physical activity, requiring acute control of your
                        body and physical endurance. Taking the SAT also takes four hours and is very fatiguing. Yet poker, giving birth and test taking aren't considered sports.</p>

                    <p>Sitting in a car for several hours and turning left all the time does not qualify an event to be athletic, and don't even get me started on "it is because of the G-forces that there exposed to" that make them athletes. No No No, NASCAR
                        drivers are highly skilled and talented drivers, but that does not make them athletes. NASCAR is simply a spectator event.</p>

                    <p>Alright what is a sport to me. Something that takes work to perfect your body to perform at peak performance. IE lifting weights, sprinting, shooting a basketball, kicking a soccer ball, catching a football etc. NASCAR drivers literally
                        do none of that. All they would need is either better parts, better cars etc. you could take a guy that sucks at racing give him the fastest car available and he is a sudden contender. Football if you suck it takes you grinding
                        and sacrificing your body slowly to become the best. The sad part is that even fans of the "sport" NASCAR have even told me that they only watch for a crash.</p>

                    <p>Football is a competition with a clearly defined goal which is achieved through physical activity and strategy, so yes. It involves strength, speed, hand-eye (or foot-eye coordination), as well as physical and mental endurance. Physical
                        endurance in itself does not constitute a sport. Lots of things that are not sports require physical endurance that are not sports; so if endurance on its own makes a sport, your definition of sport would be extremely broad.</p>
