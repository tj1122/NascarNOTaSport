            <h1>NASCAR is NOT a Sport</h1>
            <h3>While an American pastime and competition, the unfortuante truth is that NASCAR is not a sport. Here’s why:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>- By dictionary definition, auto racing does not fall under the umbrella of a “sport”.</li>
                <li>- In auto racing, the majority of the work is done by the machine itself, whereas actual sports are designed to test the limits of the human body.</li>
                <li>- NASCAR itself is purely the association promoting auto racing. It is in no way a competition or sport itself.</li>
            </ul>
